Hi, my name is [Bogdan Marian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bmarian/) aka *satrapu* and I have started this blog with
the intention of writing posts related to both Jesus Christ
(who died for everyone's sins on a *cross*) and software development
(part of the more generic *programming* term), thus resulting the
blog name *crossprogramming*.  

Each visitor is free and encouraged to choose whatever information he or she founds
more interesting.  
Please keep in mind that a person might develop software applications for a
finite period of time, some tens of years at most, while knowing Christ as
Lord and Savior is eternal.  

This blog was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator
and is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  

My editing tools:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with several extensions:
  * [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) for writing and previewing Markdown code
  * [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) for spelling purposes
* [bretfisher/jekyll-serve](https://github.com/BretFisher/jekyll-serve#getting-started) Docker image for locally running this blog
