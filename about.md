Hi, my name is __Bogdan Marian__ aka __satrapu__ and I have started this blog with
the intention of writing posts related to both Jesus Christ
(who died for everyone's sins on a *cross*) and software development
(part of the more generic *programming* term), thus resulting the
blog name *crossprogramming*.  
The link between Christ and software development is presented here: [How did I become a software developer](https://crossprogramming.com/2018/08/19/how-did-i-become-a-software-developer.html).

Each visitor is free and encouraged to choose whatever information he or she founds
more interesting.  
Please keep in mind that a person might develop software applications for a
finite period of time, some tens of years at most, while knowing Christ as
Lord and Savior is eternal.  

This blog was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator
and is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
