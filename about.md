Hi, my name is Bogdan Marian aka *satrapu* and I have started this blog with
the intention of writing posts related to both Jesus Christ
(who died for everyone's sins on a *cross*) and software development
(part of the more generic *programming* term), thus resulting the
blog name *crossprogramming*.  

Each visitor is free and encouraged to choose whatever information he founds
more interesting.  
Please keep in mind that a person might develop software applications for a
finite period of time, some tens of years at most, while knowing Christ as
Lord and Savior is eternal.  

This blog was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator
and is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
