        This site offers information related to both software development and Jesus Christ.
        <br />
        Each visitor is free and encouraged to choose whatever information he founds more interesting.
        <br />
        Please keep in mind that a person might develop software applications for a finite period of time,
        some tens of years at most, while knowing Christ as Lord and Savior is eternal.
